Blackjack is a game governed by the hypergeometric law, since a sample of n elements is extracted at random. We have an exhaustive draw of n elements (i.e. n draws without discount).
You can either start the game with a 52 cards deck or a 32 one.

This blackjack follow the model of Las Vegas blackjack.

You can see much more explanation on how we compute probabilites and how we managed to integrete random variables.
